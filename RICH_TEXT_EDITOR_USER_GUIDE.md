## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Use bold or colors for emphasis instead

❌ **Too many font sizes**
- Use the preset heading levels
- Avoid manually changing sizes

❌ **Not using headings**
- Headings help organize content
- Makes posts easier to read

## Tips for Great Posts

### 1. Start with a Compelling Title

Posts with images get more attention and engagement

### 3. Keep Paragraphs Short
3-4 sentences per paragraph makes reading easier

### 4. Use Formatting Sparingly
Too much bold/color becomes distracting

### 5. Include a Call to Action
"Register today!" or "Join us this Sunday!"

### 6. Proofread Before Publishing
Use spell check and read through once

### 7. Preview on Mobile
Many members read on phones - keep that in mind

END OF DOCUMENT
================================================================================

This document provides a comprehensive functional overview of the Church 
Digital Engagement Platform. The designer should use this to understand the 
application's purpose, user types, and feature requirements without being 
constrained by the current implementation.

The designer is expected to propose new layouts, information architecture, 
and user interface designs that meet professional enterprise standards while 
maintaining the church-appropriate, accessible, and calm aesthetic required 
for this faith-based platform.
